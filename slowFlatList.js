In React Native, a subtle issue can arise when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  If the `renderItem` function performs intensive calculations or updates within each item, it can lead to stuttering or slow scrolling, even if the individual item components are optimized. This is because `FlatList` renders items asynchronously, and if a single item takes too long to render, it blocks the rendering of subsequent items, resulting in performance degradation.  This is exacerbated if data updates trigger re-renders of numerous list items.
